# Creating a logical flow of models and building clean DAGs


- Add a tag to stablecoin_activity_per_day and stg_token_transfers:

	```jinja

	{{ config(tags=['stablecoin'])}}
	
	```

- then run 

		dbt run -m tag:stablecoin
	

- Run all models under folder base:

		dbt run -m base.*
		

- Run everything under marts folder AND with the tag stablecoin:

		dbt run -m marts.*,tag:stablecoin
		

- Run a model plus all its parents (ancestors):

		dbt run -m +eth_activity_per_day
		

- Run a model plus all its children :

		dbt run -m eth_activity_per_day+
		

- Run a model plus up to the first layer of parents and children:

		dbt run -m 1+eth_activity_per_day+1
		
		
- Run the a model, its children plus all the children parents:
		
		dbt run -m "@stg_transactions"


- Run everything undel marts folder OR having the tag stablecoin:


		dbt run -m marts.* tag:stablecoin
		


- Run a selection excluding a model or a set of models:


		dbt run --exclude my_model_to_exclude
